1. Download the dataset.
2. The dataset is mixed, so you need to manually divide the dataset into normal images and masked images.
3. Divide these images in folder named "Images" and "Masked_Images" and paste those folder here in this night_ride_dataset folder.
4. The "class_dict.csv" isn't provided with the dataset, so i've manually created that file. It is present in this folder.
